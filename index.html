        <h1>Why "Narfynerfy" is an illegal phrase and should never be used.</h1>
        <p id="definition">the phrase "narfynerfy" is mainly used in the child rape community as a phrase which has the meaning of "daisys destruction". Daisys destruction is a gore child pornography tortue movie which is 3 hours long. this video is one of the most disgusting, vile things out there and you should NEVER use this phrase in any scenario since the deep roots and meanings it has.</p>
